## Resubmission

In this version, as asked, I have documented the return values for sourcoise_reset() following guidelines.

I used the opportunity to improve documentation of other exported functions (sourcoise_refresh() and sourcoise_status()), being clearer about intended side-effects.

I solved a bug, and its is part of this resubmission.

Package still succeeds to automated checks.
