\title{Get Sourcoise Metadata for a Script}
\usage{
sourcoise_meta(path, args = NULL, root = NULL, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to the script file (character). Can be an absolute or relative path.}

\item{args}{Named list of arguments that were passed to the script, if any. Default is \code{NULL}.
This is used to identify the specific cached version when the script was executed with
different argument sets.}

\item{root}{(defaut \code{NULL}) the root of the project (you'd better rely on sourcoise for that one)}

\item{quiet}{(defaut \code{FALSE}) should we say something ?}
}
\value{
A named list containing cache metadata with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{ok}{Cache status indicator: "cache ok&valid", "invalid cache", or "no cache data"}
\item{timing}{Execution time of the full script (duration)}
\item{date}{Date and time of the last full execution}
\item{size}{Size of objects returned, measured in R memory}
\item{args}{Arguments given to sourcoise for the script}
\item{lapse}{Delay interval before reexecution is triggered}
\item{track}{List of files being tracked for changes}
\item{qmd_file}{List of Quarto (.qmd) files calling this script}
\item{log_file}{Path to the last log file}
\item{file_size}{Size of cached data on disk}
\item{data_date}{Date of last data save (note: if no new data is generated during
execution, no new data file is saved)}
\item{data_file}{Path to the cached data file (stored as .qs2 format)}
\item{json_file}{Path to the JSON file storing metadata (located in .sourcoise directory)}
}
}
\description{
Retrieves metadata about a cached script without fetching the actual data. This function
provides quick access to information about script execution, cache status, and related files.

\examples{
dir <- tempdir()
set_sourcoise_root(dir)
fs::file_copy(
   fs::path_package("sourcoise", "some_data.R"),
  dir,
  overwrite = TRUE)
# Force execution (root is set explicitly here, it is normally deduced from project)
data <- sourcoise("some_data.R", force_exec = TRUE)

# Access metadata without loading the cached data
meta <- sourcoise_meta("some_data.R")
print(meta$timing)  # View execution time
print(meta$ok)      # Check cache status
