# sourçoïse : Source and Cache

[sourcoise](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/) (pronouced
\[suʁsɔiz\] as *sourçoïse*) is a package that provides tools for running
an R script and caching the results (saving them to disk). The aim is to
be able to execute (quickly) code that accesses files or an API and
which, in the absence of updates, always produces the same result. When
the API is likely to block (or if you don’t have an internet
connection), this avoids failure of the rendering of a `qmd` document or
a quarto website.

The script code that retrieves the data from a file or an API has to be
isolated, and that is improving reproducibility.
[`sourcoise()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise.md)
can be called in a
[`sourcoise()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise.md)
which allows modularity. The cache is persistent (on disk, possibly
synched with github) across sessions of the same project. The package
provides tools, for checking the cache,
[`sourcoise_status()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise_status.md),
and refreshing it on demand,
[`sourcoise_refresh()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise_refresh.md),
or at a given frequency through a parameter of
[`sourcoise()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise.md).

## Installation

[sourcoise](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/) can be installed from
CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("sourcoise")
```

The development version can be installed from *github*:

``` r
devtools::install_gitub("xtimbeau/sourcoise")

# or (if pak is installed)
pak::pak("xtimbeau/sourcoise")
```

## Usage

To populate a graph or table with data, put the code in a script `r`
(`"mon_script.r"`), ending the script with a
`return(data_pour_le_graphique)`. In the `.qmd` or `.rmd` (or also an
`R` script) we have the instructions for the graph in a `r` code chunk:

```` qmd
```r
library(tidyverse)
library(sourcoise)

mes_datas <- sourcoise("mon_script.r")
ggplot(mes_datas) + <<graph code>>

```
````

The first time the script is run completely, subsequent calls will use
the cache on disk, persistent across session of the same project (R
project, ), unless the cache is invalidated.

To check the status of cache, just call
[`sourcoise_status()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise_status.md).
It will scan your project and collect info about your cached data. To
refresh everything, call
[`sourcoise_refresh()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise_refresh.md),
it will execute all scripts and refresh data in the cache. Options are
available to filter what really need to be refreshed.

## Many benefits

1.  time saving when code execution takes a long time (accessing an API,
    downloading large amounts of data, major processing). Reading an
    excel file can also take a long time. The time taken to access
    cached data depends on its size, but even for large data (and
    there’s no reason why it should be that large), the order of
    magnitude is a few milliseconds (less than 10ms on a MacBook Air M2)
    for execution when data is cached, thanks to optimization and
    [memoise](https://memoise.r-lib.org).

2.  the cache is transferable via *github*. It’s in a (hidden) folder,
    but saved in the project folder and *committed* and *pushed* on
    github. The cache produced on a workstation can therefore be
    accessed via `pull` on other workstations, without the need to
    re-execute the code (and thanks to a smart naming scheme, without
    too much conflicts).

3.  if the source code triggers an error, you can override it: In the
    case of a package that is not installed, missing data (for example,
    an absolute path in the code), or an API that blocks (such as the
    OECD API, particularly unreliable), then
    [`sourcoise()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise.md)
    tries to take the result of the last successful execution (if
    cached). Although this can be problematic, i.e. an unreported error
    and use of an ivalid cache, it has the enormous advantage of not
    blocking the process and allows to handle the error in parallel.

4.  [`sourcoise()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise.md)
    cleverly searches for the source file in the project and executes
    the code in a local environment, changing the working directory to
    the one where the source code is located. This makes it possible to
    call the source code (the script `r` `mon_script.r` passed as a
    parameter to `sourcoise("mon_script.r")` scripts `r` data files
    `.csv` or `.xlsx` which are saved in the same directory as the
    `mon_script.r`. You can therefore reuse the code without having to
    worry about modifying the paths, which are relative to the folder
    where `mon_script.r` is. Then, the code is resusable anywhere in the
    project or elsewhere. Note that it is done with simple copy of
    source scripts and does not compare to a common code called in many
    situation, which involves another approach (a package and functions
    for instance).

5.  This provides an embryo of reproducibility by designating the script
    that produces the data and thus allowing to complement the code
    chunk with a reference to reproduce it. It is possible to propose
    the code to be downloaded in the qmd.

## Coming soon

- the ability to store hidden data outside of the project folder (and
  therefore outside of *github*) and to use
  [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) for storage (but perhaps at the cost
  of slower access).

- a schema for declaring dependencies between calls to
  [`sourcoise()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise.md)
  calls and trigger cascade executions.

- and possibly a *shiny* update interface (*gui* for
  [`sourcoise_refresh()`](https://xtimbeau.github.io/sourcoise/reference/sourcoise_refresh.md))
